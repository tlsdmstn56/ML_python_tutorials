MIAMI
—
Gun
control
legislation
is
moving
at
an
unusually
fast
pace
in
the
Florida
Capitol
following
a
deadly
high
school
shooting,
which
has
pushed
state
lawmakers
and
the
governor
to
act
after
years
of
loosening
restrictions
on
firearms.

Powerful
budget
committees
in
the
State
House
and
Senate
signed
off
on
a
package
of
bills
on
Tuesday
that
would
raise
the
minimum
age
to
purchase
a
firearm
to
21
from
18,
mandate
a
three-day
waiting
period
for
most
gun
purchases,
and
increase
funding
for
school
safety
measures
and
access
to
mental
health
care.
The
bills
must
still
be
approved
by
the
full
House
and
Senate,
and
approved
by
Gov.
Rick
Scott.

Included
in
the
proposals
is
a
contentious,
$67
million
voluntary
program
to
arm
school
staff,
including
teachers,
trained
by
law
enforcement
to
carry
concealed
weapons
on
campus.
Lawmakers
gave
preliminary
approval
to
what
has
become
known
as
the
“marshal
program”
in
spite
of
impassioned
pleas
by
many
parents
of
Marjory
Stoneman
Douglas
High
School
students
in
Parkland,
who
said
educators
should
not
have
to
take
on
the
role
of
the
police.
A
similar
program
already
exists
in
Polk
County,
in
Central
Florida.

Linda
Beigel
Schulman,
the
mother
of
Scott
Beigel,
a
geography
teacher
who
was
killed,
told
lawmakers
her
son
had
become
a
teacher
to
teach,
not
“to
be
a
law
enforcement
officer.”
